# PongDS
Simple Homebrew Pong for DS

Zips contain Nintendo DS roms compiled and ready to play.

These are a old roms that I, James Danielson, programmed with my friend Ice1605 around 2008.  This was actually my first project for the DS...
So they aren't the best, but feel free to play around with them. A special note is that on most emulators these roms run a little odd, specially it is the scoring system on the bottom screen. It is fine on actual hardware so if you can run them on the hardware I would recommend it. The only things I have edited since making them was by changing the web link, but you'll only see that if you play the rom on actual hardware.

**Pong 3.0:**
Same as above; however, I added an extra funny mode to it, now you when the game starts you can select
either normal mode or crazy mode, if you pick the crazy mode every time you score your paddle will get 
smaller and the opponents will get bigger
