# PongDS
Simple Homebrew Pong for DS

Zips contain Nintendo DS roms compiled and ready to play.

Released: July 12, 2007.

These are a old ROMs that I, James Danielson, programmed with my friend Ice1605 summer of 2007.  This was actually my first project for the DS...
So they aren't the best, but feel free to play around with them. A special note is that on most emulators these roms run a little odd, specially it is the scoring system on the bottom screen. It is fine on actual hardware so if you can run them on the hardware I would recommend it.

**Pong 3.0:**
Same as above; however, I added an extra funny mode to it, now you when the game starts you can select
either normal mode or crazy mode, if you pick the crazy mode every time you score your paddle will get 
smaller and the opponents will get bigger

In crazy mode, your paddle gets smaller the more you score, and your opponents gets bigger.
